# Musician-Matcher
This project uses unstructured text data to create a recommendation system based on artist descriptions. The documents, available in the lastfmapi_biographies folder, are cleaned with SpaCy and vectorized with a TF-IDF transformer. Document similarity is computed with cosine similarity, which calculates the top ten most similar artists in the dataset. The code is available in the notebook MusicianMatcher.ipynb.
